### Goal:
   In part A, our model simplified $M(t)$ to be a constant value. In actuality, ambient temperature varies by season and time of day, and we need to model this fluctuation to get a proper estimation. Now that our initial function has been solved and our numerical calculator is ready, we can transform $M(t)$ into a sinusoidal function to illustrate daily temperature ranges, as well as testing summer and winter average temperatures to ensure we don't end up with a frozen or overheated Zucc. 
### Methods:
  Using the measured temperature fluctuations of a given day in Boulder, we will assume a sinusoidal oscillation with a peak to valley amplitude of 24 degrees, and a variable starting temperature $M_{0}$, being 75 in the summer and 35 in the winter. We can then plug in this variable temperature $T_{out}(t)$ to our initial equation $\frac{dT}{dt}(t)=0.25(T_{out}-T)$ and solve to get our complimentary internal temperature. We would also like to find our maximum values of our graphs to the minute precision, so that in the case of Colorado randomly forgetting which season it is and dropping to -20, we can rush Zuckerberg to his -*Redacted*- before the coldest time of the day to prevent him from turning into a pop-sickle. 

### Technical Approach
 * For our main model, $T_{out}(t)=M_{0}-12\cos\left( \frac{\pi(t-f)}{12} \right), T(0)=65$. In our summer system, plugging in $M_{0}=75$, and solving the differential equation (proof in appendix  $Fig C_{1}$), we get the equation $T(t)=75-14.3e^{-t/4}-\frac{36}{9+\pi^{2}}(3\cos(\theta)+\pi \cos(\theta))$, where $\theta=\frac{\pi(t-5)}{12}$. From plotting these two equations in Matlab, we get: ![[PartCPlot1.png]]
 * By plotting over a range of $24hours*60min$, we get a precision of minutes, and can output our max and min values from the range with the function, getting:   *Inside temperature: Minimums and Maxs of 64.56 and 83.19 at 6:58 and 20:08  Outside temperature: Minimums and Maxs of 63.00 and 87.00 at 5:00 and 16:59* 
 * We want to also get a representation of this data in the winter, so we resolve with $M_{0}=35$. We modified the matlab code to be flexible, taking in any $M_{0}$ as a perameter of the equation, and then inputted C into our $T(t)$ equation (work in $FigC_{2}$) to get![[PartCPlot2.png]]![[PartCScreenshot.png]]

### Results
* We can observe that the inside temperature is slightly out of phase with the out, in addition to having a lower amplitude. Its minimums and maximums also occur at intersections with the outside temperature, as $T_{out}-T_{in}=0=\frac{dT}{dt}$. 
* In both cases, $F(t)$ trends towards $M(t)$ initially, before reaching a sort of phase equilibrium with it after the first few hours. You can see this especially well with the graph extending up to a week ![[PartCPlot3.png]] as over time the wave of internal temperature stabalizes. This results from the fact that as $t\to \infty, Ce^{-t/4}\to 0$, and as a result $$T(t,C)=M_{0}-Ce^{-t/4}-\frac{36}{9+\pi^{2}}(3\cos(\theta)+\pi \cos(\theta))$$ approaches $$T(t)=M_{0}-\frac{36}{9+\pi^{2}}(3\cos(\theta)+\pi \cos(\theta))$$ which is a constantly oscillating function. This also means that the initial value of T becomes irrelevant over time, and no matter how hot it is it will eventually reach the same posture. We can see that our current model would allow the Zucc to be outside of his habitat requirements, and we must introduce more heat-generating elements to keep Mark toasty.
