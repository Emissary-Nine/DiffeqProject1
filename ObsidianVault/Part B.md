### Goal:
   As our calculations will involve complicated differential equations that need to be graphed, we are attempting to develop a numerics system to properly graph these equations. Our chosen software is MatLab, and we 
### Methods:
* We are going to use the Runge-Kutta fourth order estimation to create our numeric approximation for graphing. This method operates on the principle of estimating the ==slope between two values==  of the differential equation and then moving along that slope to approximate the rough movement of the equation. 
* This is an approximation, but operates off the principles that guide the definition of a derivative: $$\lim_{ h \to 0 } \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$$ in that the estimate approaches the actual equation as h approaches 0. Thus, we can achieve more accuracy by decreasing h, at the cost of compute power. Our goal is to balance speed with accuracy, tuning h to meet our criteria and comparing our answers to a solvable differential equation to measure accuracy

### Technical Approach
* First, we need a test differential equation in matlab to test our code against. We are using $\frac{dT}{dt}=0.25(75-T), T(0)=50$ as this sample equation. We are given the RK4.m function to work with as well, which takes in $t_{0},t_{f},n,y_{0},f(t)$ as variables. As such, the only function we really need to introduce is $\frac{dT}{dt}$ .  After completion, we get a full graph of the estimation of the equation.
* After this, we need to compare the error to the actual solution of the differential equation. Luckily our original equation is very easily differentiable, so we can compare a graph of it directly. Plotting $T=75-25e^{-\frac{t}{4}}$ alongside our graph, we get: ![[PartBGraphV1.jpg]] At this scale the values look almost entirely identical. Looking at the % deviation of the estimate from the actual value gives a closer view of the actual error: ![[ErrorPlot.jpg]] Where the error is on the order of $10^{-8}$%, almost entirely negligable.
### Results
* The rk4.m estimation method has proven incredibly proficient, and certainly suitable for usage in our calculations. I am quite honestly surprised with the shape of the error graph, I assumed that the error would increase over time, but it seems to spike only initially before climbing back down, seemingly correcting itself. Quite impressive!
