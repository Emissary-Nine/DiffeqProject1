## Introduction
* In 2023 AFRLP Inc. won the contract for the new 10 billion dollar Meta Compound, enclosing multiple datacenters, cubicles, and Mark Zuckerberg's -*REDACTED*-. Our team of AFRLP Engineers has been tasked with the very important task of ensuring the correct temperature ranges. We will need to evaluate our models for heat affects order to maintain the 71-85 degree temperature range necessary for -*REDACTED*- according to Pet-Smart's Lizard Ownership Manual. We will need to account for the affects of the ambient temperature outside $A(t)$, the datacenters and -*REDACTED*- guests $H(t)$, as well as our provisioned HVAC systems $Q(t)$. We can model these affects in a differential equation, $\frac{dT}{dt}= A(t) + H(t) + Q(t)$, and monitor the affects they have on temperature to evaluate the functionality of our system.
