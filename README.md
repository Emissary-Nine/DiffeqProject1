# DiffeqProject1
This is the Repo for Gabe, Ngi, and Carson's Diffeq Project 1. 

The Repo is broken into a Matlab folder and an ObsidianVault folder. The Obsidian vault acts as our documentation, to be viewed with Obsidian and the LaTeX Suite Plugin

We shouldn't need to do pull requests, just only work on your sections unless someone requests help, and anyone should be free to mess with the Obsidian files to a reasonable extent. Just use good commit messages!
